LightGBM is a unique in that the model builds trees horizontally as opposed to other algorithms that grow trees vertically. Upon further reading of the documentation we have found the biggest advantages to using this approach are as follows: \n","\n","\n","*   Can handle large data sets in less time than many other models\n","*   LightGBM models can use categorical features as an input directly without the need for one-hot encoding. It is about 8 times faster than one-hot encoding \n","*   Less Memory Usage\n","*   Because of the complexity of trees created by leaf-wise split LightGBM Models have a better accuracy as compared to other boosted models \n","\n","Disadvantages of using a LightGBM model are as follows: \n","*   Can easily overfit\n","*   Not ideal for small datasets\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","######*Sources:* \n","\n","*   https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMClassifier.html\n","*   https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-Intro.html\n","*   https://www.kaggle.com/general/264327\n","*   https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/complete-guide-on-how-to-use-lightgbm-in-python/\n"],"metadata":{"id":"S5IzXCK-5Wvk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Import Libraries & Data\n","\n","We did find a useful library (fast_ml) that creates a test, train and validation set all in one line of code.
